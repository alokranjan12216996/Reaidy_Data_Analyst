📊 Bayesian Inference Analysis for Marketing Campaign Effectiveness
📌 Project Overview

This project applies Bayesian inference to evaluate the effectiveness of a marketing campaign by comparing pre-campaign and post-campaign conversion rates.
Using a Bayesian A/B testing framework, the analysis estimates posterior distributions of conversion rates, computes the lift caused by the campaign, and quantifies uncertainty using credible intervals.

The project is designed to provide business-ready insights while demonstrating strong statistical modeling and data analysis skills.


🎯 Objectives

Model conversion rates before and after a marketing campaign

Apply a joint Bayesian A/B testing model

Estimate posterior distributions for:

Pre-campaign conversion rate

Post-campaign conversion rate

Campaign lift (Post − Pre)

Compute 95% credible intervals

Calculate the probability that the campaign improved conversions

Visualize posterior distributions and campaign lift

Summarize insights in a business-interpretable format
